    <h2>0x Programming Language Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>0x</strong> (also known as <strong>0x-lang</strong>) is an open-source, AI-first full-stack programming language that compiles to <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue 3</strong>, <strong>Svelte 5</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong> backends, <strong>React Native</strong> mobile apps, and <strong>Terraform</strong> infrastructure. It uses a declarative, indentation-based syntax that reduces code by approximately 80%. For example, 18 lines of 0x produces 96 lines of production React code.</p>

      <article class="about-content">
        <p>
          <strong>0x</strong> is an open-source, AI-first full-stack programming language designed to compile into production-ready <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue 3</strong>, <strong>Svelte 5</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong> backends, <strong>React Native</strong> mobile apps, and <strong>Terraform</strong> infrastructure.
          Instead of writing verbose boilerplate, developers write concise, declarative 0x code — and the compiler generates framework-specific output with full styling, state management, APIs, and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created for the age of AI-assisted development, 0x uses an <strong>indentation-based syntax</strong> that eliminates the structural choices (curly braces, closing tags, import statements) that cause AI hallucinations.
          The result: AI agents generate 80% fewer tokens with higher accuracy.
          0x includes a built-in <strong>MCP server</strong> for seamless integration with Claude and Cursor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a solo developer doing rapid prototyping, a team shipping multi-framework components, or an AI agent builder looking for a token-efficient intermediate representation — 0x covers your entire stack: frontend, backend, mobile, and infrastructure.
          Install with <code>npm install -g 0x-lang</code> and start compiling in under 30 seconds.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>0x is an AI-first, declarative programming language that compiles to React JSX, Vue 3 SFC, and Svelte 5 components. It uses indentation-based syntax designed to minimize token usage and eliminate ambiguity for AI code generation. 18 lines of 0x produces 96 lines of production React code. It's open-source under the ISC license and available on npm as <code>0x-lang</code>.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How do I install 0x?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Install globally via npm: <code>npm install -g 0x-lang</code>. Then create a project with <code>0x init my-app</code>, and compile with <code>0x build src/counter.ai --target react</code>. Requires Node.js 18+. Zero runtime dependencies.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What frameworks does 0x compile to?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>0x compiles to 6 targets: <strong>React</strong> (JSX + hooks), <strong>Vue 3</strong> (SFC + Composition API), <strong>Svelte 5</strong> (runes), <strong>Express.js</strong> (backend API with JWT auth, CRUD, middleware), <strong>React Native</strong> (mobile apps with StyleSheet), and <strong>Terraform</strong> (infrastructure-as-code for AWS, Vercel, Fly.io, Docker, GCP). One source file targets any or all simultaneously.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How much code does 0x save?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>On average, 0x reduces code by 80%. A counter takes 18 lines vs 96 in React (81% reduction). A todo app takes 24 vs 136 lines (82%). A dashboard takes 37 vs 185 lines (80%). These are benchmarked against production TypeScript React with full inline styling.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can I use 0x with Claude or Cursor?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. 0x has a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with Claude Desktop and Cursor. Add the 0x MCP server to your config, and AI agents can compile 0x code directly. Also available via <a href="https://server.smithery.ai/hankim/ox-lang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithery</a> for easy setup.</p>

          <summary class="faq-question">How does 0x compare to JSX?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Unlike JSX, 0x has no closing tags, no curly braces, no import statements, and no boilerplate hooks. The compiler handles all of that. 0x is also framework-agnostic — the same source compiles to React, Vue, and Svelte — whereas JSX only works with React. 0x also includes built-in layout primitives (col, row, grid) that eliminate manual CSS.</p>

        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does 0x support debugging generated code?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Since v0.1.23, 0x adds <strong>source line mapping comments</strong> to generated code. Each UI element includes a <code>{/* 0x:L5 */}</code> (React) or <code>&lt;!-- 0x:L5 --&gt;</code> (Vue/Svelte) comment linking back to the original 0x source line. This makes it easy to trace runtime errors back to your 0x code. You can disable source maps with the <code>sourceMap: false</code> compile option.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does 0x work with Next.js or Nuxt?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. For React targets, 0x automatically adds the <code>'use client'</code> directive when client-side hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback) are used, enabling seamless Next.js App Router SSR support. For Vue targets, the output is standard SFC compatible with Nuxt. You can control this with the <code>useClient</code> compile option.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can I use external JavaScript libraries with 0x?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. 0x supports three ways to integrate external libraries: <code>import { Chart } from 'chart.js'</code> for ES imports, <code>use myHook from './hooks'</code> for custom hooks, and <code>js { ... }</code> or <code>js:</code> blocks for inline JavaScript. This lets you use any npm package alongside 0x's declarative syntax.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How optimized is the generated React code?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>0x generates production-quality React code: conditional rendering with <code>{cond && (...)}</code> instead of CSS display:none, content-based keys instead of array indices, extracted style constants to reduce duplication, optimized chart computations (O(n) instead of O(n²)), and smart imports that only include hooks you actually use. The output passes ESLint and React strict mode.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Is 0x free?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. 0x is 100% free and open-source under the ISC license. Free for personal and commercial use. Source code on <a href="https://github.com/hankimis/0x-lang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

          <summary class="faq-question">Can 0x generate backend servers?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The <code>backend</code> target compiles to a full <strong>Express.js</strong> server with JWT authentication, CRUD routes, middleware, background jobs (Bull queues), caching (Redis), webhooks, S3 file storage, database migrations, and health checks. Use <code>0x build server.ai --target backend</code>.</p>

          <summary class="faq-question">Can 0x build mobile apps?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The <code>react-native</code> target compiles to React Native components with <strong>View</strong>, <strong>Text</strong>, <strong>TouchableOpacity</strong>, <strong>TextInput</strong>, <strong>StyleSheet</strong>, and native modals. Same 0x syntax you use for web — just change the target flag to <code>--target react-native</code>.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can 0x generate infrastructure code?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The <code>terraform</code> target generates <strong>HCL</strong> configuration files with provider blocks, resource definitions, and variable declarations. Supports AWS (EC2, S3, Route53, CloudFront, ElastiCache), Vercel, Fly.io, Docker, GCP, Cloudflare, Datadog, and Sentry. Use <code>0x build infra.ai --target terraform</code>.</p>

        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does 0x work with Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Since v0.1.17, 0x supports a <code>class</code> prop on all UI elements. Use <code>class="container mx-auto p-4"</code> on layouts, <code>class="text-xl font-bold"</code> on text, etc. React outputs <code>className</code>, Vue/Svelte output <code>class</code>. You can combine <code>class</code> with 0x's built-in styles. Unknown props like <code>data-testid</code> and <code>aria-label</code> also pass through as HTML attributes.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does 0x auto-optimize React performance?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The React generator automatically wraps <code>fn</code> declarations in <code>useCallback</code> with extracted dependencies, <code>derived</code> values in <code>useMemo</code>, and components with props in <code>React.memo</code>. No manual optimization needed — the compiler handles it all, eliminating unnecessary re-renders without any developer effort.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does 0x have IDE / editor support?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Since v0.1.23, 0x includes a built-in <strong>LSP (Language Server Protocol) server</strong> that provides real-time diagnostics, autocomplete, hover documentation, go-to-definition, and document symbols. A <strong>VSCode extension</strong> is available with syntax highlighting for all 73+ keywords and integrated language intelligence. The LSP server works with any editor that supports LSP — run <code>0x-lsp --stdio</code> and connect your editor's LSP client.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Since v0.1.23, all three targets have full feature parity. Vue 3 and Svelte 5 generators support every Phase 2 feature: <strong>store</strong> (localStorage persistence), <strong>data</strong> (async fetching with loading/error), <strong>form</strong> (validation + submit), <strong>realtime</strong> (WebSocket), <strong>auth</strong> (login/signup/guards), <strong>route</strong> (routing config), and <strong>model</strong> (CRUD API).

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The <code>raw:</code> block is an escape hatch that inserts code directly into JSX/template output. Use it for third-party components, custom directives, or framework-specific code that 0x doesn't abstract. Example: <code>raw: &lt;CustomComponent onSpecialEvent={handler} /&gt;</code>. For JavaScript in the script section, use <code>js:</code> blocks instead.</p>
